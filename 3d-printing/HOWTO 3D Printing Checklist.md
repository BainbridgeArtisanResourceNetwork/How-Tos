# 3D Printing Checklist

This is a set of things you should check before starting a new print job. Following these will better your odds for a successful print.

There's a lot of things to pay attention to, but doing so will increase your odds of a successful print job, with minimal waste of time and materials, and less need for intervention.

If you have questions, or need further assistance, please ask the Studio Monitor. That's what they're here for.

Happy Printing!

___
## Condensed Version

- are model parameters appropriate for the intended usage?
- do model parameters settings match printer?
- was the model sliced for the selected printer?
- do you have enough filament to print the model?
- is the selected printer compatible with that filament?
- is the printer sheet compatible with that printer and filament?
- if printing over entire bed surface have you compensated for temperature variation?

---
## Model Preparation

- Was the model oriented appropriately for printing?   
- Does the model need supports and if so are they enabled/added?
- Is the fill density and style appropriate for intended usage?
- Have you made a test print before printing multiple copies?
- Was the model sliced for the correct printer type?
   - Prusa mk3, mk4, and mini are NOT compatible files
- Was the correct nozzle size and type selected?
- Is the layer height appropriate for the object and nozzle?
- Was the appropriate filament type selected?

---
## Filament Preparation

-  is the filament correct diameter? Must be 1.75mm
-  Is the filament dry and not brittle?
-  Do you have enough filament for the job? (check the weight!)
-  Are you using studio filament for a large job? 
-  Is the filament roll properly mounted, threaded through the top bracket, and able to unroll easily?
-  Cut filament at an angle to make loading easier

---
## Printer Sheet Preparation
- Is the sheet clean, dry, and prepared for the filament type?
  - material: sheet type by preference order
  - PLA : smooth, satin, textured
  - PETG : satin, textured, smooth (Windexed or glue stick)
  - TPU : satin, textured, smooth (all with glue stick!)
  - ABS : smooth, satin, textured
  - PC : satin, textured, smooth

---
## Printer Preparation

-  is the printer appropriate for the filament and job?
   - ASA, ABS, PC should only be printed on an enclosed printer.
   - abrasize filaments should only be printed with hardened nozzle
   - PLA should not (as a rule) be printed on an enclosed printer
     - tape the door open if printing with abrasive PLA
-  is the sheet squarely fastened flat to the print bed?
-  on a Mk3 printer, is the printer calibrated for that sheet?
-  is the nozzle clean?
-  after loading filament, is it flowing cleanly?

---
## Job Start

After starting the job, make sure to check these items:
-  is the filament flowing and sticking to the bed?
-  is the first layer clean and smooth, with no gaps?
-  did you stay to make sure the first layer is looking good?
-  did you prepare a contact card so we know whose job it is?
-  if you removed someone else's job, did you put it on the shelf?
