# 3D Printing Checklist

This is a set of things you should check before starting a new print job. Following these will better your odds for a successful print.

There's a lot of things to pay attention to, but doing so will increase your odds of a successful print job, with minmimal waste of time and materials, and less need for intervention.

If you have questions, or need further assistance, please ask the Studio Monitor. That's what they're there for.

Happy Printing!

## Model Preparation

- Was the model oriented correctly for printing?   
-  Does the model need supports and if so are they enabled?
-  Was the model sliced for the correct printer type?
   - Prusa mk3 and mk4 are NOT compatible files
-  Was the correct nozzle size and type selected?
-  Was the appropriate filament type selected?
   - only the enclosed printer should be using ASA, ABS, PC, or abrasives.

## Filament Preparation

-  Is the filament dry and not brittle?
-  Do you have enough filament for the job? (check the weight.)
-  Is the filament roll properly mounted, threaded through the top bracket, and able to unroll easily?
-  Cut filament at an angle to make loading easier

## Job Start

After starting the job, make sure to check these items:
-  is the filament flowing and sticking to the bed?
-  is the first layer clean and smooth, with no gaps?
-  did you stay to make sure the first layer is looking good?
-  did you prepare a contact card so we know whose job it is?
