# HOWTO: Use 3D Printer (Ultimaker 2+)

Print projects typically take one or more hours to complete.  Please be considerate of others also wanting to use the printer.  


(TBD - comment on use of material - must you supply your own?)


Note: You must be checked-out on the printer by a member of the ETA steering committee before using the device.

## Required

- 3D model in .stl format.  Typically created by Cura or downloaded from web sites such as Thingiverse
- Material.  Nylon, PLA, others.  See [Manual: Materials](https://ultimaker.com/en/resources/manuals/materials)
- SD Card with model loaded

## Printer Use

1. **Turn power on** with rocker switch on back of unit.
- **Mount SD card** containing .stl file to be printed.
- **Remove current spool** if different materials required. Ctl Panel: Press top right selection until MATERIAL displays.  
- **Mount materials spool** on back of printer with material feeding from bottom of spool toward feed tube. Be carefull that material is free to feed and is not wrapped underneath another strand of material on the spool.  
- **Insert filament** into the bottom of the feeder and push it until it is grabbed by the feeder. Material will automatically feed through tube to print head - lightly hold material to feel if it is feeding.  
- **Allow small stream of material to feed from nozzle** when the material has fully advanced.  When previous color of material has been replaced by selected color stop.
-  **Select file to print**.  Select PRINT from the control panel then use the dial to scan through SD card contents until file is located.  When found depress the dial to select it.

#### Print

The “Print” menu allows you to select one of the print files from the SD card. Press the button to start the print.

#### Material

In the “Material” menu, you can either change the filament on your Ultimaker 2+ or change the settings of material profiles. When selecting “Change”, the Ultimaker 2+ will start the procedure as described in the “Bed leveling” section. In the “Settings” menu you can select material profiles and change their settings in the “Customize” menu.

#### Maintenance

The “Maintenance” menu offers various options. By selecting “Build plate” you will be guided through the bed leveling steps. In the “Advanced” menu, several options can be selected in order to perform certain actions manually or change machine settings. These are the options:

- LED settings: Change the settings of the LED lights in your Ultimaker 2+.
- Heatup nozzle: Set a custom temperature to manually heat up the nozzle.
- Heatup buildplate: Set a custom temperature to manually heat up the heated bed.
- Home head: Homes the head in the left back corner of the Ultimaker 2+.
- Lower buildplate: Moves the build plate to the bottom of the Ultimaker 2+.
- Raise build plate: Moves the build plate to the top of the Ultimaker 2+.
- Insert material: Heats up the nozzle after which you can insert filament.
- Move material: Heats up the nozzle after which you can use the scroll wheel to forward the material.
- Set fan speed: Set the speed of the two fans at the sides of the print head.
- Retraction settings: Customize the settings for retraction.
- Version: Shows the current firmware version on the Ultimaker 2+.
- Runtime stats: Shows for how much time the Ultimaker 2+ has been on and printing.
- Factory reset: A complete reset of your Ultimaker 2+ through which you can completely recalibrate it.

#### Fine-tuning

You can fine-tune the settings during the printing process. This allows you to get full control over the printing process and helps you achieving the best print results. You can do this by accessing the “Tune” menu during printing. The “Tune” menu basically shows you the same settings as in the “Advanced” menu, which means that you can change settings such as the temperature and speed of printing. Furthermore, it is possible to select “Pause”, after which you can change the filament in the middle of a print and resume again.
